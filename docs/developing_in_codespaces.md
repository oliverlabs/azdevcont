## Getting started with codespace

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository, which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

## Using GitHub Codespaces in Visual Studio Code

GitHub Codespaces provides you with the full development experience of Visual Studio Code. You can develop in your codespace directly in Visual Studio Code by connecting the GitHub Codespaces extension with your account on GitHub.

You can use your local install of Visual Studio Code to create, manage, work in, and delete codespaces. To use GitHub Codespaces in VS Code, you need to install the Codespaces extension. For more information on setting up GitHub Codespaces in VS Code, see "Prerequisites."

## Prerequisites

To develop in a codespace directly in VS Code, you must install and sign into the GitHub Codespaces extension with your GitHub credentials. The GitHub Codespaces extension requires VS Code October 2020 Release 1.51 or later.

Use the Visual Studio Code Marketplace to install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension. For more information, see [Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) in the VS Code documentation.
